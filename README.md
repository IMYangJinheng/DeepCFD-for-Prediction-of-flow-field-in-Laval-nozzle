# DeepCFD-for-Prediction-of-flow-field-in-Laval-nozzle
  This is a U-Net-based deep learning model, called DeepCFD. You can use this model to predict the temperature, velocity, and pressure flow fields within a Laval nozzle. We also provide the detailed nozzle parameters, meshes, cases, and model training dataset, as well as the script used to generate the dataset. If you would like to request the complete dataset, please contact us.
  
  The structure of U-Net is below.
