# DeepCFD-for-Prediction-of-flow-field-in-Laval-nozzle
This is a U-Net-based deep learning model, which we call DeepCFD. You can use this model to predict the temperature, velocity, and pressure flow fields within a Laval nozzle. The specific nozzle parameters, mesh, case, and model training dataset are also provided. If you need the complete dataset, please contact us.
